If you had more time, what would you have changed in your code?

    1) I would be changed UI on FE
    2) I would be added added more logging on BE
    3) I would be changed responses to be the same (have equal shape)
    4) I would be added comments
    5) I would be added more validation of incoming data

What would you have changed in the UI you created?

    1) price cards
    2) color scheme

What are the problems that you can foresee if the company needs to scale? 
(Be also specific to changes you would have made in your code for scaling. 
You don't need to implement these changes.)

    1) many request for determine coordinates of address
        
        I would be implemented caching for coordinates

    2) there is no any logging on BE. It would be hard to determine any issues.

        I would be implemented more logging
